    This quote is stuck in my head:
    <blockquote cite="https://anilist.co/manga/137428/The-Mimosa-Confessions/">
      "'And yeah, like Nakki said, I wouldn’t worry too hard about whether what
      you’re doing is wrong or right. I mean, what’s that thing we learned about
      in econ class the other day? The invisible hand? You know, the thing about
      how everyone benefits when people act in their own self-interest. So yeah,
      I think you should just focus on doing what you wanna do.'"

    It is such an alluring shortcut. It flashbangs my brain every time I think
    of moral or ethical dilemmas.
