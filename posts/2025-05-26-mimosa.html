This quote is stuck in my head:

  "'And yeah, like Nakki said, I wouldn’t worry too hard about whether what
  you’re doing is wrong or right. I mean, what’s that thing we learned about in
  econ class the other day? The invisible hand? You know, the thing about how
  everyone benefits when people act in their own self-interest. So yeah, I think
  you should just focus on doing what you wanna do.'"

It is such an alluring shortcut. It flashbangs my brain every time I think of
moral or ethical dilemmas.
